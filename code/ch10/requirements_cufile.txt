# Requirements for cuFile (GPUDirect Storage) Example
# 
# This example demonstrates REAL cuFile API usage for GPUDirect Storage
# on CUDA 13.0+ systems with GDS support (B200/B300 + NVMe)

# CUDA Python bindings with cuFile support (CUDA 13.0+)
# Note: This requires CUDA 13.0+ to be installed on the system
cuda-python>=13.0.0

# PyTorch for GPU tensor operations
torch>=2.0.0

# NumPy for data generation
numpy>=1.24.0

# Installation notes:
# ====================
# 
# 1. Install CUDA 13.0+ toolkit:
#    - Download from: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
#    - Ensure GDS is enabled during installation
# 
# 2. Install Python packages:
#    pip install -r requirements_cufile.txt
# 
# 3. Verify GDS is enabled:
#    - Check /etc/cufile.json exists
#    - Run: cufile_sample_00 (from CUDA samples)
# 
# 4. Hardware requirements:
#    - NVIDIA B200/B300 GPU (or A100/H100 with GDS support)
#    - NVMe SSD on supported PCIe configuration
#    - GDS-capable system (see NVIDIA GDS documentation)
# 
# Fallback behavior:
# ==================
# If GDS is not available, the example will:
# - Use traditional CPU-mediated path
# - Display simulated GDS performance characteristics
# - Serve as educational comparison
